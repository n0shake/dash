# DoorDash-API

It's always fun back engineering REST APIs, and understanding how the app interacts with the Internet. Door Dash encrypts its network traffic using SSL, but this is really easy to get around using a simple Man-in-the-middle attack.

# Major 🔑

As with many mobile apps, DoorDash uses a token-based system. The base URL for the api is https://api.doordash.com/.
